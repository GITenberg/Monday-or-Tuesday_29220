description: Originally hand-printed at her Hogarth Press in Richmond, Monday or Tuesday
  is the only collection of short stories that Virginia Woolf published during her
  lifetime, providing a fascinating insight into the early stages of development of
  themes that would blossom in her later masterpieces. From the impressionist description
  of four groups of people walking by a flowerbed in the botanic gardens at Kew to
  the soaring flight of a heron above the teeming life of towns and cities below and
  the reveries of a woman as she looks at a mark on the wall, the eight pieces included
  in this volume showcase Woolf's inimitable observational powers and her boldly modern
  style of writing.
